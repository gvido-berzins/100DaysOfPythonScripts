Simple selenium automation for filling a specific google form.

## Prerequisites

Chromedriver in the current directory or edit the code to a different one.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

```
python google-form-fill.py
```

## Purpose

This is a script I made a long time ago and this was because, I wanted to
win an airdrop, but it was time based so I wanted to automate it partly
but it turned out to be more different then I imagined.
