Python Discord bot with a bunch of commands that interact with APIs and event commands.

## Prerequisites

A Discord app and a bot needs to be created on the Discord developer page. For my case, also heroku needs to be setup to host the bot.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

I used it with heroku and just push to the `heroku` remote's `main` branch

```
git push heroku main
```

After this the bot should be up and running if everything was previously configured.
