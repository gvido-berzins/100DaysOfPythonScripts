A Simple script runner & logger

## Prerequisites

No need to install additional libraries, only standard library was used.

## Usage

Run with

```
python script.py smb.txt
```

## Purpose

This script was made, because I needed some small automation to process some
files with another Python script, so I decided to experiment with logging, etc.
