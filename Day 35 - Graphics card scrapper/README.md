Yet another web scrapper, but for graphics cards. (Doesn't work because
of captcha on the website)

## Prerequisites

Pushbullet API key

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the script with Python

```
python mine-watch.py
```

## Note

This was made for a specific website, but this script failed, the reason
is captcha, yeah, I didn't want to waste time with this.

## Purpose

I wanted a notification when a graphics card would be available.
