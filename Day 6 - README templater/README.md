Utility script for creating `README.md` files from a base template.

## Prerequisites

No need to install additional libraries, only standard library was used.

## Usage

Run the script with Python

```
python readme_templater.py
```

## Next steps

I will most likely keep updating this script, because it was made to make
my work easier to create these `README.md`.

The first thing to improve will be the `prefills`, it's not as handy as
the additional section creator.

## Notes

This `README.md` was created by the same script. :)

P.S.

Be careful, this will overwrite without warning (happened to me twice :)).
