Flask app with the output dynamically printed on the page. (on-screen logging.)

## Prerequisites

pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install -r requirements
```

## Usage

Run the script with Python

## Next steps

I wanted to finish this, but I couldn't do it yet, I'm planning to get
more experience with Flask and JavaScript and then come back to this.
