A simple script for editing JSON file contents with pretty printing

## Prerequisites

Everything's from stdlib, no needed dependencies.

## Usage

**WARNING!** Will modify file in place!

Run the script with Python

```
python replace_json.py
```

## Motivation

There was a need for me to modify contents in a lot of JSON files, so for
that I wrote a script so I don't have to do a lot of manual work.
